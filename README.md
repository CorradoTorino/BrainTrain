# BrainTrain
 A set of exercises to maintain healthy coding skills.

## Exercise Available

- **MyHashTable** A dummy hash table not intended to replace a dictionary ;)

- **MyStringBuilder** A dummy string builder handling just string appending.

- **Exercise 1. Returns the smallest positive integer that does not occur in an array** Write a function: 
```class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }```
that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].
